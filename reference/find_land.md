# Find the name of the land on which the occurrence points were found

Use various mapping tools to attempt to find the names of land masses
where the occurrence points were found.

## Usage

``` r
find_land(occurrences, fillgaps = FALSE)
```

## Arguments

- occurrences:

  A dataframe output by
  [`rgbif::occ_search()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/rgbif/reference/occ_search.html)
  or
  [`rgbif::occ_download()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/rgbif/reference/occ_download.html)
  (or if using a custom dataframe, ensure that it has the following
  columns: decimalLongitude, decimalLatitude, acceptedScientificName,
  genericName, specificEpithet, datasetKey). The "datasetKey" column is
  important for GBIF records and identifies the dataset to which the
  occurrence record belongs. Custom dataframes without this style of
  data organization should fill the column with placeholder values.

- fillgaps:

  (logical) Attempt to use Photon API to fill in gaps left by
  `mapdata::map.where()` (TRUE) or only `mapdata::map.where()` results
  (FALSE, default). While it is powerful, the Photon API does not have a
  standard location for island names in its returned information, so
  using it will likely require the returned dataframe to be cleaned by
  the user.

## Value

A dataframe of the species name, longitude, latitude, and three parts of
occurrence information. "first" is the name used to describe the largest
possible area of land where the occurrence point is found. "second" is
the name used to describe the second-largest possible area of land that
corresponds with the occurrence point. "third" is the most specific area
of land that corresponds with the occurrence point. Functions later in
the ssarp pipeline default to checking whether "third" has an entry,
then look at "second," and then "first."

## Examples

``` r
# The GBIF key for the Anolis genus is 8782549
# Read in example dataset filtered from:
#  dat <- rgbif::occ_search(taxonKey = 8782549,
#                           hasCoordinate = TRUE,
#                           limit = 10000)
dat <- read.csv(system.file("extdata",
                            "ssarp_Example_Dat.csv",
                            package = "ssarp"))
occs <- find_land(occurrences = dat, fillgaps = FALSE)
```
