# Assessing Spatial Autocorrelation

## Introduction

Species-area relationships (SARs) and speciation-area relationships
(SpARs) are impacted by the environmental and spatial characteristics of
the islands (or island-like areas) of interest. When inferring SARs and
SpARs, researchers typically treat these effects as part of the broader
biogeographic processes that are captured by the SARs and SpARs
(Triantis et al. 2012). However, ignoring spatial effects when inferring
SARs and SpARs can result in biased parameter estimates (Barros et
al. 2023).

Testing for spatial autocorrelation, when data from spatially nearby
locations is not independent from each other, allows researchers to
determine whether these spatial effects are impacting parameter
estimates. This vignette provides an example of testing for spatial
autocorrelation for a dataset including species richness of Galápagos
finches. This dataset was created using the Galápagos finch
presence-absence matrix published with the `cooccur` R package (Griffith
et al. 2016), and then using `ssarp` to associate those islands with
their areas.

``` r

# Load libraries
library(ssarp)
library(spdep)

# Read in finch data
finch_dat <- read.csv(system.file("extdata",
                                  "finch_richness.csv",
                                  package = "ssarp"))

# Print first 5 lines of finch_dat
head(finch_dat, n = 5)
```

## Testing for Spatial Autocorrelation using Moran’s I

Moran’s I (Moran 1950) is a commonly used metric for testing for spatial
autocorrelation in ecological data (Dormann et al. 2007). Here, we will
use the `spdep` R package to calculate Moran’s I for our Galápagos finch
data.

An important step in calculating Moran’s I is to identify spatial
neighbors in the dataset. In order to do this for our Galápagos finch
data, we need to load a shapefile for the Galápagos Islands. An
excellent shapefile is available from the [Galápagos
Geoportal](https://geodata.fcdarwin.org.ec/catalogue/#/dataset/489), and
is included as an `.rda` file in the `extdata` folder as part of `ssarp`
for ease of use in this vignette.

``` r

# Load shapefile. The object will be called "galap_shape"
load(system.file("extdata",
                 "galapagos_islands.rda",
                  package = "ssarp"))
```

Next, we will merge the finch data with the Galápagos shapefile.

``` r

# Merge shapefile (galap_shape) with finch data (finch_dat) by 
#  the island name ("nombre" in the shapefile and "island" in the finch data)
islands <- merge(x = galap_shape, 
                 y = finch_dat,
                 by.x = "nombre",
                 by.y = "island")
```

Now, we can use the newly created `islands` spatial object to calculate
the distance between neighboring islands and create a list of spatial
weights necessary for calculating Moran’s I. We will accomplish this
goal using distances between centroids of all of the islands on which
finches occur.

``` r

# Find coordinates for the centroids of all of the islands 
#  to use in the neighbor calculation
coords <- st_coordinates(st_centroid(islands))

# Identify centroid neighbors for each island
# d1: lower bound for distance
# d2: upper bound for distance
# Islands are considered neighbors if the distance is between d1 and d2

# d2 is 30000m in this example, informed by prior distance calculations within
#  the Galápagos archipelago
neighbors <- dnearneigh(coords, d1 = 0, d2 = 30000)

# Assign spatial weights to the neighbors list for use in the Moran test
# style = "W": row-standardized, which is the most-commonly used (Dormann et al. 2007)
neighbor_weights <- nb2listw(neighbors, style = "W")
```

Finally, we can run the Moran’s I test to determine whether Galápagos
finch richness is biased by spatial autocorrelation.

``` r

# zero.policy = TRUE allows for islands to have no neighbors
moran.test(islands$richness, neighbor_weights, zero.policy = TRUE)
```

    ## 
    ##  Moran I test under randomisation
    ## 
    ## data:  islands$richness  
    ## weights: neighbor_weights    
    ## 
    ## Moran I statistic standard deviate = 0, p-value = 0.5
    ## alternative hypothesis: greater
    ## sample estimates:
    ## Moran I statistic       Expectation          Variance 
    ##     -5.882353e-02     -5.882353e-02      5.421011e-17

With a p-value of 0.5, we can conclude that Galápagos finch species
richness is not spatially structured. We can also conclude that the SAR
for Galápagos finches is not driven by the structure of geographic
distances between the islands on which they occur.

As a note of caution, this result is only indicative of a particular
spatial grain and the particular species included here. Species richness
might be spatially structured at a different grain (for example, between
habitat fragments), but not at the island level. We encourage
researchers to fully explore the potential of spatial autocorrelation in
their datasets before drawing conclusions about the parameters of SARs
and SpARs.
