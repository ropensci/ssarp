# Contributing to ssarp

Thank you for considering contributing to *ssarp*! The following guidelines were created by editing the CONTRIBUTING.md file created by `usethis::use_tidy_contributing()`.

## Fixing typos

You can fix typos, spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors in the documentation directly using the GitHub web interface, as long as the changes are made in the _source_ file. 
This generally means you'll need to edit [roxygen2 comments](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/roxygen2.html) in an `.R`, not a `.Rd` file. 
You can find the `.R` file that generates the `.Rd` by reading the comment in the second line.

### Fixing island database entries

If you are working with *ssarp*'s built-in database of island names, areas, and elevations and notice an issue with any entry in this dataset (e.g., the area for one of the islands in your study system is incorrect, an island in your study system is entirely missing), please feel free to open a pull request after doing the following: (1) make a change directly to `data-raw/island_areas.csv` and (2) run `data-raw/island_areas.R` to replace the old dataset with your newly edited version.

## Bigger changes

If you want to make a bigger change, it's a good idea to first file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it’s needed. 
If you’ve found a bug, please file an issue that illustrates the bug with a minimal 
[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex) (this will also help you write a unit test, if needed).
See tidyverse's guide on [how to create a great issue](https://code-review.tidyverse.org/issues/) for more advice.

### Adding methods for estimating speciation rate or streamlining workflows

We especially welcome users to file issues proposing new methods for estimating speciation rates to be added to *ssarp*. We would value the opportunity to collaborate with folks who are passionate about a particular method! We also welcome users to file issues proposing new additions to the *ssarp* workflow that would allow *ssarp* outputs to integrate seamlessly with other packages that users find useful for further analyses.

### Pull request process

*   Fork the package and clone onto your computer. If you haven't done this before, we recommend using `usethis::create_from_github("kmartinet/ssarp", fork = TRUE)`.

*   Install all development dependencies with `devtools::install_dev_deps()`, and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`. 
    If R CMD check fails with an error, it's a good idea to ask for help before continuing. Warnings about non-ASCII strings in the `island_areas` object and the files in the `vignettes` subdirectory can be safely ignored.
*   Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using `usethis::pr_init("brief-description-of-change")`.

*   Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR by running `usethis::pr_push()`, and following the prompts in your browser.
    The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.
    The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.

### Code style

*   Please do not restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.

*   New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org).

*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with [Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html), for documentation.  

*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit tests. 
   Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.
